                                            so why not create and offer flavored rice. They will first offer 
                                            3 common flavors of rice, namely Riso (Plain Rice), Aglio 
                                            (Garlic Rice) and Burro (Buttered Rice) so that their market, 
                                            which by the way are students, will first be familiar with the 
                                            flavors and when they fully accepted the idea, then the group 
                                            will offer exciting new flavors.
